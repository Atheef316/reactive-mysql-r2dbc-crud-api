# reactive-mysql-r2dbc-crud-api
This repository includes my hands-on project developed with Spring Boot WebFlux and R2DBC MySQL. It demonstrates a fully reactive CRUD service for employees and covers setup, database configuration, and endpoint implementation. I’m maintaining this as part of my learning in reactive microservices and asynchronous data access.
